## Introduction
My name is Brianna Lee and I am a junior. I enjoy listening to music and playing games.

## Goals for the School Year
I hope to get all A´s in all my classes in both semesters. I also hope to pass my AP exams. I think that I would also like to devleop better studying habits.

## Volunteer Work
I joined leadership this year and volunteered about 3 times during the summer. I helped with any teacher´s problems. I assisted Mrs. Kim move from F Hall to D Hall. I also gave out lockers to the incoming freshmen. Almost every Sunday I taught at sunday school. I currently teach 1st graders and have learned how to work with others.

## Favorite Summer Food
I have seen a popular asian snack called Tanghulu, go viral and wanted to try it. So I made it at home and shared it with my family. It is a very sweet and crunchy snack. I really enjoyed it and have given the experience to my friends.

## Fun Fact About Yourself
I have an amazing dog named Chewie. I have had Chewie for about 6 years. He is a 10 year old male dog. 

## Most Memorable Experience
My most memorable experience was probably my church retreat. I feel like I was really able to get my priorities because I didn´t have my phone for 2 days. I got to spend time with my friends and in general had an amazing time.
